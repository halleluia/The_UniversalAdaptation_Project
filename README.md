# The_UniversalAdaptation_Project

You can easily run the project by following procedures:
1. Run the '应用.html' file on VSCode;
2. You can repack all the fonts-related folders by yourself, but you have to change the codes in the iconfont.css file to make sure the code run correctly;
3. Try to see the effects of the codes in different size of screen to ensure that the effect can adapt all kind of screen size.

Notice:
1. All these codes are perfectly run on my PC. So if there are something wrong with your usage, it's crucial to check the paths and the codes;
2. You better use the Chrome browser to see the effect.
